# Setup
You can easily set up the program by running the `setup.py` file.
It will create an `auth.json` file, which you need to fill in with the following data:
```
{
    "auth": {
        "username": " ",
        "cookie": " ",
        "user_agent": "",
        "x-bc": ""
    }
}
```
To obtain this information, log in to your OnlyFans account, press F12, and locate the cookie, x-bc header,

You can also obtain this data by using cookie helper tools.

This is what the auth file should typically look like:
```
{
    "auth": {
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
        "x-bc": "jncx05ryygvsu6e2q44e830l49stj1ab16e9xpal",
        "auth_id": "123456",
        "sess": "1pfa4tyad154lwyztvbjfdcnlk",
